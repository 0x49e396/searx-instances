<!-- please answer the following questions (replace [ ] by [x] to say yes) -->

* [ ] It is my instance.
* [ ] I give the right to searx.space to check my instance (every 3 hours for the response times, every 24 hours for the other tests).

<!--

If you have modified searx, please provide a URL to the source code and make sure that the same URL is publicly accessible in your instance's site.

Currently, if you don't give the right to searx.space to check your instance, it is not possible to add your instance to the list.

Be sure to have configured filtron:
* once your instance is added to searx.space, it will receive requests from different bots which may increase its chance of getting blocked by various search engines.
* removing your instance from searx.space won't stop the bots and thus will most likely not unblock it from the various search engines.

About searx.space:
* source code: https://github.com/dalf/searx-stats2
* your instance will receive requests from the host check.searx.space (the IP addresses of this host may change in the future)
